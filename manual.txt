NAME
       run0 - Elevate privileges

SYNOPSIS

       run0 [OPTIONS...] [COMMAND...]

DESCRIPTION
       run0 may be used to temporarily and interactively acquire elevated or different
       privileges. It serves a similar purpose as sudo(8), but operates differently in a
       couple of key areas:

       -¢   No execution or security context credentials are inherited from the caller
           into the invoked commands, as they are invoked from a fresh, isolated service
           forked off by the service manager.

       -¢   Authentication takes place via polkit[1], thus isolating the authentication
           prompt from the terminal (if possible).

       -¢   An independent pseudo-tty is allocated for the invoked command, detaching its
           lifecycle and isolating it for security.

       -¢   No SetUID/SetGID file access bit functionality is used for the implementation.

       Altogether this should provide a safer and more robust alternative to the sudo
       mechanism, in particular in OS environments where SetUID/SetGID support is not
       available (for example by setting the NoNewPrivileges= variable in systemd-
       system.conf(5)).

       Any session invoked via run0 will run through the "systemd-run0" PAM stack.

       Note that run0 is implemented as an alternative multi-call invocation of systemd-
       run(1).

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --no-ask-password
           Do not query the user for authentication for privileged operations.

           Added in version 256.

       --unit=
           Use this unit name instead of an automatically generated one.

           Added in version 256.

       --property=
           Sets a property on the service unit that is created. This option takes an
           assignment in the same format as systemctl(1)'s set-property command.

           Added in version 256.

       --description=
           Provide a description for the service unit that is invoked. If not specified,
           the command itself will be used as a description. See Description= in
           systemd.unit(5).

           Added in version 256.

       --slice=
           Make the new .service unit part of the specified slice, instead of user.slice.

           Added in version 256.

       --slice-inherit
           Make the new .service unit part of the slice the run0 itself has been invoked
           in. This option may be combined with --slice=, in which case the slice
           specified via --slice= is placed within the slice the run0 command is invoked
           in.

           Example: consider run0 being invoked in the slice foo.slice, and the --slice=
           argument is bar. The unit will then be placed under foo-bar.slice.

           Added in version 256.

       --user=, -u, --group=, -g
           Switches to the specified user/group instead of root.

           Added in version 256.

       --nice=
           Runs the invoked session with the specified nice level.

           Added in version 256.

       --chdir=, -D
           Runs the invoked session with the specified working directory. If not
           specified defaults to the client's current working directory if switching to
           the root user, or the target user's home directory otherwise.

           Added in version 256.

       --setenv=NAME[=VALUE]
           Runs the invoked session with the specified environment variable set. This
           parameter may be used more than once to set multiple variables. When "=" and
           VALUE are omitted, the value of the variable with the same name in the
           invoking environment will be used.

           Added in version 256.

       --background=COLOR
           Change the terminal background color to the specified ANSI color as long as
           the session lasts. If not specified, the background will be tinted in a
           reddish tone when operating as root, and in a yellowish tone when operating
           under another UID, as reminder of the changed privileges. The color specified
           should be an ANSI X3.64 SGR background color, i.e. strings such as "40", "41",
           ..., "47", "48;2;...", "48;5;...". See ANSI Escape Code (Wikipedia)[2] for
           details. Set to an empty string to disable.

           Example: "--background=44" for a blue background.

           Added in version 256.

       --machine=
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container name to connect
           to.

           Added in version 256.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

       All command line arguments after the first non-option argument become part of the
       command line of the launched process. If no command line is specified an
       interactive shell is invoked. The shell to invoke may be controlled via
       --setenv=SHELL=...  and currently defaults to the originating user's shell (i.e.
       not the target user's!) if operating locally, or /bin/sh when operating with
       --machine=.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned. If run0 failed to start the session or the specified
       command fails, a non-zero return value will be returned.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       As with systemd-run, the session will inherit the system environment from the
       service manager. In addition, the following environment variables will be set:

       $TERM
           Copied from the $TERM of the caller. Can be overridden with --setenv=

           Added in version 256.

       $SUDO_USER
           Set to the username of the originating user.

           Added in version 256.

       $SUDO_UID
           Set to the numeric UNIX user id of the originating user.

           Added in version 256.

       $SUDO_GID
           Set to the primary numeric UNIX group id of the originating session.

           Added in version 256.
